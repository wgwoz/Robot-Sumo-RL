# Robot Sumo RL Training System

## **CHANGES BY ME (wgwoz)**

I have forked this repo and used most of it functionality. I have changed size of model and robot inputs/outputs, in order to make it more realistic and later deployed to phisical robot.
- 5 analog opponent sensors
- 3 digital line sensors
- differential drive
I have also changed  phisics model to better fit my goals.
- slippage and wheel spinout (the later deactivated)
- momentum
- better traction from front than from sides/back to promote flanking

I have modified reward function extensivley and trained 3 models. SAC, SAC128 and PPO. In my findings, SAC128 started performing the best followed by PPO followed by SAC. It seems that SAC strarted to overfit. 

Most of the work was made by Sebastian, the original author, I have adapted his codebase to my needs. I have used help of copilot and codebase is not tidy rn


> [!IMPORTANT]
>  State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Implementation: As of January 2026, this repository represents the most advanced open-source framework for Robot Sumo combat, being the first to provide a comprehensive benchmark of SAC, PPO, and A2C algorithms integrated with a competitive self-play mechanism.

This project implements an autonomous Robot Sumo combat agent trained using Reinforcement Learning (Actor-Critic architecture). The system utilizes a specialized training environment featuring a **self-play mechanism**, where the learning agent competes against a "Master" model or its own historical versions to continuously evolve and refine its combat strategies. 

Key features include a sophisticated **reward shaping engine** designed to promote aggressive forward movement, precise aiming, and strategic ring positioning while penalizing passive behaviors like spinning or backward driving.

## System Architecture

The following block diagram illustrates the closed-loop control system. It distinguishes between the **Mobile Robot** (physical/sensing layer) and the **RL Controller** (decision layer). Note that the goal signal $\mathbf{r}_t$ is only utilized during the training phase to shape the policy via the reward engine.

### Functional Blocks

* **Controller (RL Policy):** A neural network-based agent (e.g., SAC, PPO, or A2C) that maps the current observation vector to a continuous action space. It operates as the inference engine during the deployment phase.
* **Dynamics:** Represents the second-order physical model of the robot. It calculates the response to input forces and torques, accounting for mass, moment of inertia, and friction, influenced by external **Disturbances** (SAT Collisions).
* **Kinematics:** A state integration block that transforms generalized velocities into global coordinates. It maintains the robot's pose relative to the arena's origin.
* **Sensor Fusion (Perception):** A preprocessing layer that transforms the robot state vector, raw global state data and environment information (e.g., opponent position) into a normalized, egocentric observation vector.

### Signal Vectors

The communication between blocks is defined by the following mathematical vectors:

* $\mathbf{r}_t$: **Reward/Goal signal** – utilized exclusively during training to guide the policy optimization via the reward shaping function.
* $\mathbf{a}_t = [v\_{target}, \omega\_{target}]^T$: **Action vector** – control commands representing desired linear and angular velocities.
* $\dot{\mathbf{x}}_t = [\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\theta}]^T$: **State derivative** – the instantaneous generalized velocities calculated by the dynamics engine.
* $\mathbf{y}_t = [x, y, \theta]^T$: **Physical output (Pose)** – the current coordinates and orientation of the robot in the global frame.
* $\mathbf{s}_t$: **Observation vector (`state_vec`)** – an 11-dimensional normalized feature vector containing proprioceptive cues (velocity) and exteroceptive spatial relations (distance to opponent/edges).

## State Vector Specification
The input state vector (`state_vec`) consists of 11 normalized values, providing the agent with a comprehensive view of the situation on the arena:

| Index | Parameter | Description | Range | Source / Sensor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `v_linear` | Robot's linear velocity (forward/backward) | [-1.0, 1.0] | Wheel Encoders / IMU Fusion |
| 1 | `v_side` | Robot's lateral velocity | [-1.0, 1.0] | IMU (Accelerometer) / State Estimation |
| 2 | `omega` | Rotational velocity | [-1.0, 1.0] | Wheel Encoders / Gyroscope (IMU) |
| 3 | `pos_x` | X position on the arena | [-1.0, 1.0] | Odometry / Localization Fusion |
| 4 | `pos_y` | Y position on the arena | [-1.0, 1.0] | Odometry / Localization Fusion |
| 5 | `dist_opp` | Normalized distance to the opponent | [0.0, 1.0] | Distance Sensors (IR/Ultrasonic) / LiDAR |
| 6 | `sin_to_opp` | Sine of the angle to the opponent | [-1.0, 1.0] | Geometry (based on distance sensors) |
| 7 | `cos_to_opp` | Cosine of the angle to the opponent | [-1.0, 1.0] | Geometry (based on distance sensors) |
| 8 | `dist_edge` | Distance to the nearest arena edge | [0.0, 1.0] | Floor Sensors (Line detectors) / Geometry |
| 9 | `sin_to_center` | Direction relative to the arena center | [-1.0, 1.0] | Line sensors / State Estimation + Geometry |
| 10 | `cos_to_center` | Direction relative to the arena center | [-1.0, 1.0] | Line sensors / State Estimation + Geometry |


## Reward Shaping Details
The reward system is designed to enforce aggressive combat and strategic survival:

* **Terminal Rewards:** Large bonuses for winning and significant penalties for falling out or timing out (draw).   
* **Backward Block:** Reverse driving is strictly penalized and cancels other rewards for that step.
* **Anti-Spinning:** Penalties for excessive rotation to prevent aimless spinning.
* **Forward Progress:** Rewards for moving forward are scaled by targeting accuracy (facing the opponent).
* **Kinetic Engagement:** High-magnitude bonuses for maintaining forward velocity while directly facing the opponent, encouraging decisive attacks.
* **Edge Safety:** Proactive logic that penalizes movement toward the abyss and rewards returning to the arena center.
* **Combat Dynamics:** Rewards for high-velocity head-on collisions (pushing) and penalties for being hit from the side or rear.
* **Efficiency:** A constant time penalty per step to encourage the fastest possible victory.

## Environment Specification
The simulation environment is built to reflect official Robot Sumo competition standards with high physical fidelity:

* **Arena:** 
    * **(Dohyo):** Modeled with a standard radius (77 cm) and a defined center point. The environment strictly enforces boundary conditions; a match ends (Terminal State) as soon as any corner of a robot's chassis exceeds the `ARENA_DIAMETER_M`.     
* **Robot Physics:** 
    * **Chassis:** Robots adhere to the 10x10 cm square dimensions (`ROBOT_SIDE`).
    * **Dynamics:** The system implements mass-based acceleration, rotational inertia, and friction models (including lateral friction to simulate tire grip).
* **Collision System:** Real-time contact handling is powered by the **Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)**. It calculates non-elastic overlaps and applies physical impulses, affecting both forward and lateral velocities based on the robots' mass and restitution.
* **Start Conditions:** Features a standard starting distance (~70% of arena radius) with support for both fixed positions and randomized 360-degree orientations to enhance training robustness.


## Performance Analysis & Benchmarks

The tournament results clearly demonstrate the evolution of combat strategies and the efficiency of different Reinforcement Learning architectures. The comparison shows a clear hierarchy in both peak performance and the speed of convergence.

### Tournament Leaderboard & Efficiency

| Rank | Agent | Model Versions | ELO Rating | Episodes Required |
|:----:|:-----:|:--------------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| 1-5  | **SAC** | v19 - v23 | **1391 - 1614** | **~378** |
| 6-10 | **PPO** | v41 - v45 | **1128 - 1342** | **~1,049** |
| 11-15| **A2C** | v423 - v427| **791 - 949** | **10,000 - 24,604**|

> [!NOTE]
> **Note on Convergence Rate:** There is a massive disparity in sample efficiency across architectures. SAC reached its peak potential significantly earlier, requiring approximately **3x fewer episodes** than PPO and over **60x fewer** than A2C to converge to a proficient combat level.

### Key Takeaways

* **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) Efficiency:** SAC is the undisputed winner in this environment. Its off-policy maximum entropy framework allowed it to reach the highest skill ceiling (1614 ELO) with the best sample efficiency. 
    * *Behavioral Note:* SAC agents developed a sophisticated ability to recover their orientation when displaced and actively exploit even minor positioning mistakes made by the opponent.
* **PPO Stability & Tactics:** PPO remains a reliable contender, offering stable training and competitive performance. While it plateaus at a lower ELO than SAC, it remains a robust choice for continuous control.
    * *Behavioral Note:* Interestingly, PPO agents excelled in "clinch" situations, learning tactical maneuvers to unbalance the opponent during close-quarter contact to gain a positioning advantage.
* **A2C Performance Gap:** The basic Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm struggled significantly with sample efficiency and stability. Even with extensive training, its performance remained below the starting ELO of the more advanced architectures, highlighting the limitations of simpler on-policy methods in this task.
* **Architecture Evolution:** The project highlights that modern off-policy methods (SAC) are far better suited for **continuous, non-linear control tasks** than traditional on-policy methods. SAC's ability to maximize entropy while learning from off-policy data leads to more sophisticated, adaptive combat behaviors and a significantly higher performance ceiling.

* **Automated Analytics & Statistics**: Creating a script to analyze model decisions and generate detailed metrics (e.g., average steps per round, spin frequency, and specific collision types like rear-end or lateral impacts).
* **Ablation Studies**: Parameterizing the reward shaping function to conduct ablation studies, isolating how individual components (e.g., positioning vs. aggression) contribute to the stability and convergence of SAC and PPO.
* **Evaluation Harnesses & Regression Testing**: Developing a suite of fixed tactical scenarios (e.g., edge-recovery challenges, specific starting orientations) to serve as a regression test suite, ensuring new model versions don't lose fundamental skills while optimizing for higher ELO.
